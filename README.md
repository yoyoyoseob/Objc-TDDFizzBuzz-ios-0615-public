# Objc-TDDFizzBuzz

# Goals 

* Use Test Driven development to solve the popular CS FizzBuzz problem  
* Get used to the idea of testing first, and the practice of red green refactor

# Classic Fizz Buzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

ex output: 
` 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz `
 
We'll be slightly modifying FizzBuzz to build a solution using TDD.  The key difference is our FizzBuzz will take two arguments startNumber and endNumber, allowing for any range of numbers we wish.  Make sure to read all of the following instructions before starting and to write the tests before implementing the corrosponding features in code. 

Instructions
=====================

#Test 1
1. Write a test that asserts that a `FizzBuzz` object can be instantiated i.e. alloc init'ing a `FizzBuzz` object returns an object of class `FizzBuzz`.
2. Run your test (It won't even compile because the FizzBuzz class doesn't exist)**Red**
3. Create a class called `FizzBuzz` (subclass of NSObject) and import FizzBuzz.h into your Test Class 
4. Run your test (It should pass)**Green**

#Test 2
1. Write a test that tests setting FizzBuzz's `startNumber` property. 
2. Run your test (Again it won't compile)**Red**
3. Add the `startNumber` property to your `FizzBuzz` class (remember, properties automatically generate setters and getters!) 
4. Run your test (It should pass)**Green**

#Test 3
1. Write a test that tests setting FizzBuzz's `endNumber` property. 
2. Run your test (Again it won't compile)**Red**
3. Add the `endNumber` property to your `FizzBuzz` class
4. Run your test (It should pass)**Green**

#Test 4
1. Write a test that tests FizzBuzz's init Method with two assertions.  The goal of these assertions is to show that after initializing, startNumber and endNumber default to `@0`. ie. if startNumber and endNumber aren't set, they return @0.    
2. Run your test (This time it will compile but will fail)**Red**
3. Implement FizzBuzz's init method to pass this test. **Green**
 
#Test 5
1. Write a test that tests initialization of `FizzBuzz` property values when using a designated initializer.  Remember, an example of a designated initializer would be NSString's initWithString method. In the case of FizzBuzz, the designated initializer should set the startNumber and endNumber properties. 
2. Run your test (It won't compile)**Red**
3. Add the designated initializer to your FizzBuzz Class' .h file and implement in the .m file. Run your test. **Green**

#Refactor
1. Hazah! Adding a designated initializer to the mix gives us a chance to refactor things a bit.  In your init method, you set the properties of start number and end number.  Why not just use the designated initializer to do the same work in less lines of code. 
2. **Refactor** your init method to use your designated initializer to set `startNumber` and `endNumber` to `@0`.
3. Run your test.**Green**

#Test 6
1. Write a test that asserts that the array returned from `[FizzBuzz getValuesBetweenNumber:@0 andNumber:@15]` is equivalent to `@[@"0",@"1",@"2",@"Fizz",@"4",@"Buzz",@"Fizz",@"7",@"8",@"Fizz",@"Buzz", @"11", @"Fizz", @"13", @"14", @"FizzBuzz"]` .
2. Run your test! (It won't compile)**Red**
3. Implement the `- (NSArray *)getValuesBetweenNumber:(NSNumber *)startNumber andNumber:(NSNumber)endNumber;` method and run your test. **Green**
